Critical Thinking Questions Chapter 9

1. The index value of the third element in an array is 2.


2. int[] quantities = new int[19];


3. Double heights[] = {1.75,2.15,4.95};


4. for (int integer: grades)
{
        System.out.println(integer);
}


5.

 a) 
int newData = 1;
Int[] array = new int[10];
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
        array[i] = array[i] + 1
}
array[0] = newData;






b)
int newData = 10;
Int[] array = new int[10];
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
        array[i] = array[i + 1]
}
array[10] = newData;


6. When passing in a whole array you only need to write the type of array with square brackets and then its name. 
If you are passing in a single element from the array you will have to indicate which one by using its index 
and putting that index number into the square brackets. 


7. Instead of having an array with a lot of elements inside of it that will not be used you can use an offset array index. 
This helps so you can have the first element of an array start at whichever number you like and it also gets rid of the countless unused elements. 
If an array required 5000 elements but only the last couple hundred were being used the solution would be an offset array index. 
This would make it so the 0th element would start at 4501 or whichever number you would like. 


8. The character that will be displayed will be “i”.
